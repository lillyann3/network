🕸️ Net Work is a digital fishing net made of memory, care, and sound.
Visitors are invited to submit voicemails for the language that remembers them 
using voice, glitch, and story as threads to mend the net.

🛠️ Hand-coded with care, experimentation, and joy.

            <p class="context">
                In Vietnamese fishing villages, nets were never mended alone.
                They were repaired slowly, together.
                Each repair held the memory of the hands that did the work.<br><br>
                This website is a living net mended through voicemails.
                Not to fix language, but to hold it.
