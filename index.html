This site is part of Lillyanne Pham’s digital residency project
hosted by Welcome to My Homepage in Feb 2026.

🧑🏻‍🎨 Lillyanne Pham (LP) is an artist who makes work with people. 
They create murals, workshops, games, and digital projects shaped by friendship, 
care, and shared memory. Their work moves across archives, gardens, and public art. 
It pays attention to what people carry, what they are asked to give up, and how ideas of 
home are made and remade through everyday relationships. Learn more at lillyannepham.com <333

🕸️ Net Work is a digital fishing net made of memory, care, and sound.
Visitors are invited to submit voicemails for the language that remembers them 
using voice, glitch, and story as threads to mend the net.

🛠️ Hand-coded with care, experimentation, and joy.
